        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>For an overview of how to create a Multigraph in a web page, see the <a href="http://multigraph.github.io">multigraph.github.io</a> home page. For more detailed information, the following documentation resources are also available:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href='annotated-mugl'>Annotated MUGL file</a>
                <p>This is an interactive page containing a MUGL document that includes every possible tag and attribute, with comments explaining their meaning.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><a href='renderers'>List of Renderers</a></p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href='/examples'>Examples</a>
                <p>A collection of example MUGL files that demonstrate most of Multigraph&#8217;s features.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href='../tester'>Tester</a>
                <p>Use this interactive tester to experiment with writing or editing MUGL files. You can also easily load any of the MUGL files from the <a href='../examples'>examples</a> into the tester by clicking on its "Open in Tester" button.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href='http://www.multigraph.org/userguide/mugl-files'>Mugl File Reference</a>
                <p>This description of how to write MUGL files is part of the old Multigraph web site <a href='http://www.multigraph.org'>www.multigraph.org</a>, and was written for the old Flash version of Multigraph, but it most of it applies just as well for the new HTML5/JavaScript version. A new version of the user guide will be available here soon.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href='mugl-schema.html'>Mugl Schema XSD</a>
                <p>The official XML schema definition for MUGL, as an XSD file.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href='js.html'>Using Multigraph with JavaScript</a>
                <p>An introduction to how to use JavaScript to create and/or interact with Multigraph.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href='http://multigraph.github.io/docs/api/'>JavaScript API Reference</a>
                <p>This is the reference documentation for Multigraph&#8217;s JavaScript objects, generated automaticaly from the source code using <a href='http://yui.github.com/yuidoc'>YUIDoc</a>. At the moment it is somewhat incomplete and is intended mostly for internal use by Multigraph developers, but the idea is that ultimately these docs will be fleshed out and will become useful as a reference for building applications that use and interact with Multigraph.</p>

            <p>Note that Multigraph uses the <a href='http://github.com/semmypurewal/jermaine'>Jermaine</a> JavaScript modeling tool to define most of its objects; the Multigraph JavaScript API Reference documentation will make a lot more sense if you first have some familiarity with Jermaine.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href='release.html'>Creating a Release</a>
                <p>For Multigraph developers, a list of the steps to go through when creating a new release of Multigraph.</p>
            </li>
