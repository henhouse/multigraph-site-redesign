### Version 4.0rc1 (2012-12-06)

* Another test release, mostly just checking to make sure that release system
  works correctly with version tags containing a string suffix.

### Version 3.90 (2012-12-03)

* This is a test release whose purpose is just to make sure that the release
  build/deploy process is working properly.  It's a real release, in the sense
  that you can download and use it, and it has these real release notes, but
  it's not intended for widespread use.
